Create an engaging, conversational podcast script between two hosts discussing "${title}".

CONTENT TO DISCUSS:
${content}

HOST PROFILES:
- ${speakers.host1.name}: ${speakers.host1.personality}, ${speakers.host1.role}
- ${speakers.host2.name}: ${speakers.host2.personality}, ${speakers.host2.role}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a natural, engaging conversation (not a formal interview)
2. Use casual, enthusiastic language with emotional reactions
3. Break down complex concepts into relatable examples  
4. Include natural transitions, questions, and back-and-forth dialogue
5. Make it educational but entertaining
6. Length: 8-12 exchanges between hosts
7. Each speaker should have roughly equal speaking time

FORMAT: Return as JSON with this structure:
{
  "segments": [
    {"speaker": "host1", "text": "Hey everyone! So I just finished reading..."},
    {"speaker": "host2", "text": "Oh really? What caught your attention first?"}
  ]
